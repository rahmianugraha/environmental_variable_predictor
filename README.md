# Environmental Variable Predictor

This code creates elevation, slope, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps in Google Earth Engine (GEE) according to Rijal (2020) with modifications: the LST was retrieved from the Landsat 8 by deriving the values from NDVI and the top of atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance.
